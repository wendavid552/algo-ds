# Notes or codes in learning algorithms and data structres.
I am a university student and I am trying to use GitHub to save all of my codes and notes in learning algorithms and data structres.

My codes and notes will be divided to three kinds: those just realize the most basic algorithm or data structres, those have added something more(e.g. Not only maintain the balance of the sequences, but also provides functions for adding new elements, modifying elements and so on), those are some related practising problems in the onlinejudge system.
